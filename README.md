# FarmChain

**Blockchain-Powered Agricultural Supply Chain Transparency Platform**

---

## 🚨 The Problem

India's agricultural supply chain faces several critical systemic issues that hurt both farmers and consumers:

- **Critically Low Farmer Income**  
  Farmers receive only **16-20%** of the final consumer price, with the remaining **80%** absorbed by a chain of intermediaries.
  
- **Widespread Fraud & Mislabeling**  
  **25%** of "organic" food in India is fraudulently mislabeled, eroding consumer trust.

- **Systemic Inefficiency & Waste**  
  **15-20%** of produce is lost post-harvest due to specific lack of accountability and poor logistics.

- **Payment Delays**  
  Farmers face crippling payment delays of **2-4 weeks** on average, forcing them into debt cycles.

- **Opaque Supply Chain**  
  Consumers have **zero visibility** into the origin, chemical usage (pesticides/fertilizers), or freshness of their food.

## 💡 Our Solution

**FarmChain** creates a direct, immutable, and transparent connection between farmers and consumers using **Blockchain Technology**. By removing unnecessary middlemen and recording every step of the journey on a public ledger, we ensure fair pay for farmers and guaranteed quality for consumers.

### 🎯 Our Approach

We leverage a hybrid architecture combining a user-friendly **Next.js Frontend**, a robust **GraphQL Backend**, and a secure **Ethereum/Polygon Blockchain** layer. This ensures that while the user experience remains fast and seamless, the core data regarding product origin and quality remains tamper-proof.
