# FarmChain

**Blockchain-Powered Agricultural Supply Chain Transparency Platform**

## Overview

FarmChain is a platform designed to address transparency and trust issues in the agricultural supply chain by using blockchain technology to create an immutable record of produce from farm to consumer.

## The Problem

India's agricultural supply chain faces several critical issues:

- Farmers receive only 16-20% of the final consumer price, with the remaining 80% going to middlemen
- 25% of organic food in India is fraudulently mislabeled
- 66% of civil cases in India involve agricultural disputes
- 15-20% of produce is lost post-harvest due to lack of accountability
- Farmers face payment delays of 2-4 weeks on average

The current supply chain involves multiple intermediaries (farmer → trader → wholesaler → retailer → consumer), each taking a significant cut while adding minimal value. This creates poverty for farmers despite their hard work, and leaves consumers unable to verify the quality, origin, or organic status of their food.

## Solution

FarmChain creates a direct, transparent connection between farmers, businesses, and consumers using blockchain technology to verify and track agricultural products throughout the supply chain.

### For Farmers

- Register farms with GPS verification
- Log all farming activities (seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, harvest dates)
- List produce directly to businesses, eliminating middlemen
- Receive instant payments through smart contracts
- Obtain blockchain-verified organic certification

### For Businesses

- Browse verified produce with complete history
- Post demand requirements and receive competitive bids from farmers
- Verify product quality and origin before purchase
- Pay through escrow system (funds released only upon delivery confirmation)
- Track deliveries in real-time

### For Consumers

- Scan QR codes on products to view complete journey
- See farmer information and farm location
- Verify organic claims through blockchain certificates
- Check harvest dates and storage conditions
- Make informed purchasing decisions with full transparency

## Core Features

**1. Complete Traceability**  
Each product receives a unique QR code linked to its blockchain-verified journey from seed to shelf.

**2. Chemical Transparency**  
All pesticides and fertilizers are logged with WHO safety classifications.

**3. Organic NFT Certificates**  
Verified organic farms receive blockchain-based certificates that cannot be forged.

**4. B2B Reverse Auction**  
Businesses post requirements, farmers submit competitive bids, ensuring fair market pricing.

**5. Smart Contract Escrow**  
Payments are held in escrow and automatically released upon delivery confirmation.

**6. Journey Visualization**  
Interactive maps show transport routes, storage conditions, and temperature logs.

## How It Works

**Farmer Registration**
- Creates farm profile with GPS location
- Logs all farming activities on blockchain
- Lists produce for sale

**Business Ordering**
- Browses marketplace or posts demand
- Reviews complete farming history
- Places order with escrow payment

**Delivery Tracking**
- GPS and temperature logged throughout journey
- Real-time updates to all parties
